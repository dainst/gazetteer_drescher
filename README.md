# gazetteer_drescher
Script for harvesting the [iDAI.gazetteer](https://gazetteer.dainst.org/).

## Requirements
* [pymark](https://github.com/edsu/pymarc) for generating MARC output.

## Usage
Simply run `python <format type> <output file>`. For information about the supported types run `python -h`.

The script `config.py` can be used for basic configuration and to include additional scripts for new output formats. These have to be added under `output/`.
